About
-----

RosarioSIS has been designed to address the most important needs of administrators,
teachers, support staff, parents, students, and clerical personnel. However, it
also adds many components not typically found in Student Information Systems.
Consider the following:

* Student screens that include all the critical information necessary for
	reports and decision-making can be accessed with a point and click.
	Several customizable features are also included that allow you to gather
	data important to your school or district.

* Employee screens that not only provide quick access to demographic
	information, but also assign email addresses, admittance to the system,
	passwords, and more.

* Students can be searched by not only gender, ethnicity, grade level, etc.,
	but also by their schedule, activities, absences, eligibility, grades,
	GPA, and class rank, where appropriate.

* A comprehensive grade book that allows teachers to establish grade ranges,
	weight assignments, track assignments, and issue quarterly and semester
	grades as well as progress reports. Report card and transcripts are also
	available.  Furthermore, report cards and transcripts can be configured
	to display grades for any or all of your schools marking periods on
	the fly.

* Attendance can be taken electronically by teachers and submitted to the
	office almost instantly. Also, office staff can modify attendance
	reports based on information not available at the time roll was taken.
	The attendance component further provides report capabilities to
	identify average daily attendance, to provide daily attendance
	summaries, and to track attendance each day.

* Middle grade and high school educators will appreciate the eligibility
	feature of RosarioSIS. No longer will paper or spreadsheets have to be used
	to report what students are eligible for athletic or academic
	activities; instead, the grade book will determine electronically if a
	student is passing or not. The teacher then merely verifies the
	information and sends it through the system.

* Scheduler in RosarioSIS allows the scheduling of entire classes or groups as
	well as the scheduling of a single student. Revisions to a students
	schedule can be performed quickly.  Scheduling based on a students
	requests is extremely efficient.  Running the scheduler on an entire
	high school takes minutes instead of hours.  So, the scheduler can be
	run several times a day allowing you to scheduler more thoroughly.
	Also, each time you save a students requests, the scheduler is run
	under test mode for the student allowing you to resolve conflicts as
	you have the student in front of you.

* Courses can be added easily to include weights, instructional assignments,
	and periods. As well, you can determine if each course requires
	attendance, affects the honor roll and class rank, and/or has any
	restrictions. Of course, scheduling reports can be generated through
	this application also.

* A calendar is included that details events, activities and student
	assignments.

* A school set-up screen is used to establish marking periods, the grade
	levels in the building, and the number of periods scheduled each day.
	School demographic information (e.g., name, address, phone numbers,
	etc.) is entered on this same screen.  Your schools can have any number
	of marking periods in three tiers.  For instance, a school could use the
	conventional two semesters, four quarters, four progress periods model,
	or a school could establish its only system of marking periods with 3
	semesters, 18 quarters, and 36 progress periods.  Everything is
	completely customizable.

* Keep track of student billing by easily assigning fees and their corresponding
	payments. As well, you can consult balances, daily transactions and print
	statements.

* A full set of [additional modules and plugins](https://www.rosariosis.org/add-ons/) to expand the possibilities
	of your school and staff in terms of communication, additional reports,
	data import and integrations with other solutions.

You will find RosarioSIS to be a full-featured Student Information System that
facilitates your decision-making, provides data necessary for reports to the
federal or state governments as well as local boards, and affords convenient
access to all of the stakeholders in your building or district. And, because it
is web-based, the system can be logged into from any Internet connection.
